## The problem behind the project
Eight wetlands of Belarus located in natural reservations were on the edge of survival because of peat extraction. Despite of official status — natural reservations — the territories were under a threat of being exploited by the government in economical inefficient and environmental harmful way.

## Measures taken
Public campaign “*In Defense of Belarusian Wetlands*” was supported by 90 public organizations and 19,000 people in Belarus. Thanks to activity of campaign the biggest part of territories was saved from commercial development and remained in former boundaries.

## The project
As a part of the campaign this site was developed to spread the word about Belarus wetlands drainage and motivate people to sign the [petition](http://www.change.org/sohranim-belorusskie-bolota) on Change.org. The site was launched in January of 2013.

The website visually demonstrates environmental consequences of wetlands commercial exploitation.
There are eight stories, one for a wetland, which describe how unique the territories are and how they will change after harmful usage, peat extraction, agriculture and animal husbandry.
